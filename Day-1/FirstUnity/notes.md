# ***Your First Unity Script and Code***
Organized project Files and created first message in Unity.

1. Created Scenes and Scripts folders to organize the new game project.
    
2. Wrote my first print statement in Unity
    - The void ***Start() method*** runs when the game object the script is attached to is added to the scene (when the script is enabled).
    
    - The voice ***Update() method*** runs to refresh the Update at "once per frame," meaning it is continuous.
        - For this example script, we removed the Update method as the message only needed to be printed once. Instead we make a print statement: print("Hi, n00b");

    - Once the print statment was saved in VSCommu., We need to drag the message from the project window on an object in the game's hierarchy window. In this example we attached it to the main camera.
